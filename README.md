# LCB Image Bank

This is a repository of open-licensed images derived from the stories in the [Little Cree Books](http://littlecreebooks.com/) collection.

## Source

The image bank was created as a side effect of generating the stories for [LCB Source](https://github.com/global-asp/lcb-source) and the [Global Little Cree Books Project](https://github.com/global-asp/global-lcb).

There are similar imagebanks available for the [African Storybook](https://github.com/global-asp/asp-imagebank) and [Pratham Books](https://github.com/global-asp/pb-imagebank), which this repository has been modelled on.

## Image sizes

Since the original images are relatively large, they have been made available in this repository in two different sizes for convenient re-use in other applications. The original size images are in the `large` folder. The images in the `medium` folder are approximately half the size of the corresponding images in the `large` folder.
